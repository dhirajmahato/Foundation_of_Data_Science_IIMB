## Foundation of Data Science IIMB Swayam Course

*According to Dr Jim Gray, Data Science is the fourth paradigm that drives innovative solutions to organizational problems.*

- basic concepts in probability such as joint and conditional probabilities.
- ML algorithms for Market Basket Analysis and Recommender Systems.
- random variables, discrete and continuous probability distributions, sampling, estimation and central limit theorem
- feature selection to avoid overfitting and underfitting
- regression and logistic regression use hypothesis testing to select features.
- optimization techniques, and algorithms such as Gradient Descent

In analytics, we usually deal with problems under uncertainty. **Probability** is a measure of uncertainty and it becomes essential part of data science. Data is usually reported in a matrix form and thus the knowledge of **linear algebra** is important for understanding intricacies in analytical model development. In AI and ML, while trying to find the Feature Weights, we end up minimizing a loss function and thus optimization concept becomes the base for data science.

#### Week1: Descriptive Statistics and Data Visualisations
Descriptive Analytics is used to describe data and derive insights using descriptive statistics, data visualization and queries. Descriptive analytics involves finding “what has happened” in a specific business context using the past data. Analyzing past data can provide insights that can assist organizations in taking appropriate decisions.

1. Data Types and Scale
2. Population and Sample
3. Measure of Central Tendency
4. Percentile, Decile, and Quartile
5. Measure of variation
6. Measure of Shape
7. Data visualisation charts
