## Foundation of Data Science IIMB Swayam Course

*According to Dr Jim Gray, Data Science is the fourth paradigm that drives innovative solutions to organizational problems.*

- basic concepts in probability such as joint and conditional probabilities.
- ML algorithms for Market Basket Analysis and Recommender Systems.
- random variables, discrete and continuous probability distributions, sampling, estimation and central limit theorem
- feature selection to avoid overfitting and underfitting
- regression and logistic regression use hypothesis testing to select features.
- optimization techniques, and algorithms such as Gradient Descent

In analytics, we usually deal with problems under uncertainty. **Probability** is a measure of uncertainty and it becomes essential part of data science. Data is usually reported in a matrix form and thus the knowledge of **linear algebra** is important for understanding intricacies in analytical model development. In AI and ML, while trying to find the Feature Weights, we end up minimizing a loss function and thus optimization concept becomes the base for data science.

#### Week1: Descriptive Statistics and Data Visualisations
Descriptive Analytics is used to describe data and derive insights using descriptive statistics, data visualization and queries. Descriptive analytics involves finding “what has happened” in a specific business context using the past data. Analyzing past data can provide insights that can assist organizations in taking appropriate decisions.
