one-way analysis of variance (abbreviated one-way ANOVA) is a technique that can be used to compare whether two samples means are significantly different or not (using the F distribution). This technique can be used only for numerical response data, the "Y", usually one variable, and numerical or (usually) categorical input data, the "X", always one variable, hence "one-way".

### Two-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
The two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an extension of the one-way ANOVA that examines the influence of two different categorical independent variables on one continuous dependent variable. The two-way ANOVA not only aims at assessing the main effect of each independent variable but also if there is any interaction between them.
