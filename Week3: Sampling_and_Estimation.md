## Week3: Sampling and Estimatiion

### Sampling

Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of observations from a population to make an inference about various population parameters such as mean, proportion, standard deviation etc.

- It is an important step in **inferential statistics**.<br/>
- Sampling is necessary when it is difficult or expensive to collect data on the entire population. <br/>
- Sampling is necessary because even when the entire population is available, using the entire population for estimation of a population parameter may not be feasible.

The process of identifying a subset from a population of elements (aka records or observations or cases) is called **sampling process or simply sampling.**

The following steps are used in any sampling process: for attrition among young professionals
1. **Identification of target population:**  --> attrition among IT professionals in the age group 25â€“35 years.
2. **Decide the sampling frame:** Sampling frame defines the source (or method/procedure) used for -->  use data captured by many human resource departments across multiple companies.
3. **Determine the sample size:** determined using factors such as effect size, standard deviation, desired level of confidence, and margin of error.
   > For multivariate models such as multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and factor analysis, a thumb rule such as a sample 20 or 30 times the number of
   > independent variables are used. That is, if there are 10 variables, then a sample size of 200 in most cases would be acceptable.
4. **Sampling method:** for selecting individual cases in the sample
   - two major categories: *probabilistic sampling* and *non-probabilistic sampling*.
   - Probabilistic sampling is further classified into random sampling, stratified sampling, etc
   - Bootstrap aggregating (also known as Bagging) and Boosting are two popular sampling methods used in machine learning algorithms.
