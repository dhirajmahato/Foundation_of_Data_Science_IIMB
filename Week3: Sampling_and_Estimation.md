Sampling is the process ofselecting a subset of observationsfrom a population to make an inference about various population parameters such as mean, proportion, standard deviation etc.

> It is an important step in **inferential statistics**
> Sampling is necessary when it is difficult or expensive to collect data on the entire population. 
> Sampling is necessary because even when the entire population is available, using the entire population for estimation of a population parameter may not be feasible.
