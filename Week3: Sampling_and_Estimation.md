### Sampling

Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of observations from a population to make an inference about various population parameters such as mean, proportion, standard deviation etc.

- It is an important step in **inferential statistics**.<br/>
- Sampling is necessary when it is difficult or expensive to collect data on the entire population. <br/>
- Sampling is necessary because even when the entire population is available, using the entire population for estimation of a population parameter may not be feasible.

The process of identifying a subset from a population of elements (aka records or observations or cases) is called **sampling process or simply sampling.**

The following steps are used in any sampling process:
1. Identification of target population:
2. Decide the sampling frame: 
3. Determine the sample size:
4. Sampling method:
