### Terminology
- **Random Experiment** is an experiment in which the outcome is not known with certainty prior to the occurrence of the event. That is, the output of a random experiment cannot be predicted with certainty.
- **Sample space** is the universal set consisting of all the possible outcomes of an experiment.
- **Event(E)** is a subset of the sample space.
- **Probability Estimation using Relative Frequency**: P(X) = Number of observations in favour of event X / Total number of observations
- **Algebra of Events**:  Assume that X, Y and Z are three events  --

### Fundamental Concept of Probability

#### Axioms of Probability

#### 1. Marginal Probability

Marginal probability is simply the probability of an event X, denoted by P(X), without any prior conditions. unconditional probability that is known as Marginal Probability.

#### 2. Joint Probability
Let A and B be two events in a sample space. joint probability of the two events, written as P (Aâˆ©B)
