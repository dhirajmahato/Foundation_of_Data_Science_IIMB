## Week5: Hypotheis Testing

### Introduction

Hypothesis testing is used to establish evidence of an association relationship between an outcome variable and predictor variables.

- Hypothesis test consists of two complementary statements called null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis, only one of which can hold true.
- The objective of hypothesis testing is to either reject or retain a null hypothesis.

> Data analysis in general can be classified as exploratory data analysis or confirmatory data analysis.<br/>
>  In exploratory data analysis, the idea is to look for new or previously unknown hypotheses or suggest hypotheses. In the case of confirmatory data analysis, the objective is to test the validity of a hypothesis (confirm whether a hypothesis is true or not) using techniques such as **hypothesis testing** and **regression.**

#### Classified 
1. Paramteric hypothesis testing
2. Non-Parametric hypothesis testing

2. Null(H0) and Alternative Hypothesis(H1)  ----> https://youtu.be/9NJ2v5kEz0E
3. Test-Statistic: p-value is evidence against null hypothesis ----> https://youtu.be/scT8JvQ9r1E
4. Decision Criteria – Significance Value, α ---> https://youtu.be/x2-RiAzmXho

|Comparison |                  |
|-----------|------------------|
|p-value< α | Reject the null hypothesis |
|p-value>= α | Retain the null hypothesis |

#### one-tailed test and a two-tailed test 
A one-tailed test and a two-tailed test are alternative ways of computing the statistical significance of a parameter inferred from a data set, in terms of a **test statistic.**

- A two-tailed test is appropriate if the estimated value is greater or less than a certain range of values, this method is used for null hypothesis testing and if the estimated value exists in the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted over the null hypothesis.
- A one-tailed test is appropriate if the estimated value may depart from the reference value in only one direction, left or right, but not both.
