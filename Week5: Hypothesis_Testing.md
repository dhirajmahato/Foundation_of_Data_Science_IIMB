Hypothesis testing is used to establish evidence of an association relationship between an outcome variable and predictor variables.

- Hypothesis test consists of two complementary statements called null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis, only one of which can hold true.
- The objective of hypothesis testing is to either reject or retain a null hypothesis.

> Data analysis in general can be classified as exploratory data analysis or confirmatory data analysis.<br/>
>  In exploratory data analysis, the idea is to look for new or previously unknown hypotheses or suggest hypotheses. In the case of confirmatory data analysis, the objective is to test the validity of a hypothesis (confirm whether a hypothesis is true or not) using techniques such as **hypothesis testing** and **regression.**
